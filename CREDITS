This utility would not be possible without the many contributions to the
Apache Commons project.

This utility uses three Apache Commons libraries (in the lib directory) which
are available under the APLv2 (included as LICENSE.txt in the lib directory).

Multiple sources indicate that the APL is compatible with GPLv3, the main
license for this project.
