# Bare Minimum PasteBin

This project is intended for very specific circumstances.

* You're headed to the cottage, or somewhere with a good WiFi router but spotty internet.
* You want to be able to copy and paste snippets of text (not Rich Text) between your devices.
* You're able to prepare before you head up, or download something small (1 MB) at an opportune time.
* There's going to be a computer there, or at least something capable of getting and running a Java program.
* The WiFi is trusted, so you don't need any kind of security or authentication.

If all of those are true, then this utility might be useful to you.
