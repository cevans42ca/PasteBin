This project is intended for very specific circumstances.

* You're headed to the cottage, or somewhere with a good WiFi router but spotty internet.
* You want to be able to copy and paste snippets of text between your devices.
* You're able to prepare before you head up.
* There's going to be a computer there, or at least something capable of getting and running a Java program.
